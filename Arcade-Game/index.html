				Our asset confirmed that a chest (attachment n°1) that contains top secret documents has been sealed and hidden in this maze.<br>
				A map (attachment n°2) is required to find the key (attachment n°3) and the chest. Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to find this chest and its content (for a national security matter, you can't know the nature of this content) and get back without being caught. Due to budgetary cuts, your cover is this sole blond wig, so be careful.<br>
				Our inside man marked the map position for you.</br>
				Beware, guards are patrolling this maze and they don't like intruders.<br>
				Good luck.<br><br>
				<b>PS</b>: We have informations that gemstones have been scattered in the facility. See if you can find them, so we can get you more than a simple wig.
