The user can open the Settings menu either by pressing the Escape key, or clicking the cog icon in the top right corner of the page.

**_Note: The same Escape key will also close the modals._**
The cards are reset when closing it.

#### Available options

* **VFX:** Let the user enable or disable the sounds.
* **Gameplay:** Let the user choose if the timer is enabled. If so, they have 45 seconds to finish the game. Otherwise, the timer is disabled and only the moves will impact the final score.
* **Difficulty:** In the Regular mode, the cards are displayed on click. In the «Hard» mode, the cards are displayed on comparison.
